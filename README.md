# SimulPynk

SimulPynk is a package designed to allow the user to create compute graphs python.
It comes with a graph execution engine, opperators and very soon multiprocessing.
You can see it as a way to create declaratively series of transformations over data in python (like excel's formulae).

Modulo an understanding of how steps are handelled, it can also allow you to make simulation like [Simulink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulink) and even translate your blocks diagrams in python.

Must of all it was designed for robotics and implementation of control loops but you can use it for whatever you want  ^_^.

## what is a compute graph ?

### waT THe HeLL iS A GRapH ???
The short anwser is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)).
(I would direct my attention to directed graph. (<-you see what I did there ^_^))
